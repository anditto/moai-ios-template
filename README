Moai template for iOS.

This already does all the steps (and some minor changes) as written on 
http://getmoai.com/wiki/index.php?title=Building_Moai_Games_For_iOS_Devices .

There should be no build problems, and it should build into a "Test successful..." screen.

Just replace the main.lua file in the /lua folder, and you're good to go!
